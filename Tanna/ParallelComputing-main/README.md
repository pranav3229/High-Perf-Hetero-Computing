# Parallel Computing

## About
This repo contains the labs and assignments that were given as part of Parallel Computing course, BITS Pilani, 2021-22.

The labs were based on pthreads, OpenMP, MPI and cuda.

## Summaries
### Assignments

There were two assignments. 
1. In first assignment, I was tasked to implement and test the performance of prefix sums using Blelloch and Hillis algorithms.
2. In second assignment, I was tasked to parallelize the huffman coding - both encoding and decoding portions.

### Labs
There were 3 lab submissions:
1. In first lab, I had to compute exponential of a given number using sequential and parallel algorithms. The number of terms were fixed to be 100. Then, I was tasked to measure their performance.
2. In second lab, I had to implement the linear and log barrier for threads waiting for other threads to finish.
3. In third assignment, I had to compute the value of pi using MPI and then compute the efficiencies for multiple number of processes.
